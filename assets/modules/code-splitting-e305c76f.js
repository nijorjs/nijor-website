All the pages in your app are lazy-loaded and there\'s no way to change it !\n    </section4ttow>\n    <section4ttow title="Lazy-loading a component" n-scope="iomqzRZuEbN8JlV4">\n        To lazy-load a component, just add the <highlight4ttow n-scope="iomqzRZuEbN8JlV4">lazy</highlight4ttow> attribute after it.\n        <code4ttow n-scope="iomqzRZuEbN8JlV4">\n            &lt;card1 n:imported="components/card.nijor"/&gt; &lt;!--Without Lazy Loading--&gt;\n            &lt;card2 n:imported="components/card.nijor" lazy/&gt; &lt;!--With Lazy Loading--&gt;\n        </code4ttow>\n    </section4ttow>\n'}),(async function(){t.init("section4ttow"),await t.run(),o.init("highlight4ttow"),await o.run(),i.init("code4ttow"),await i.run()}));export{e as default};
